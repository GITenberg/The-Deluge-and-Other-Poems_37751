<P CLASS="poem">
Love, it is dark among your roses,<BR>
The face of the moon is turned away,<BR>
The nightingale is silent and lonely;<BR>
Lean from your window a little way!&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Lean but a little way towards me,<BR>
Out of the window where jasmines twine,<BR>
Open the lattice, softly, slowly,<BR>
Till the light of your eyes shall gladden mine.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Love, it is dark among your roses;<BR>
And how, since the nightingales are fled,<BR>
Can I tell your heart how my heart is lowly,<BR>
To touch the ground where your sandals tread?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This is your garden; these your flowers;<BR>
These stars have seen you; these dews have known;<BR>
And now your eyes and your smile you give me&mdash;<BR>
Give me your love, and be all mine own!<BR>

My husband made it for me ere we wed,<BR>
And sang it in my garden; I arose<BR>

To all his kisses.  Ah! those days were sweet.<BR>

I am happy in his love<BR>
And thank God for it, nay, propitiate<BR>
With vows and offering; I fear a wrath<BR>
Called down on too great happiness; I fear&mdash;<BR>
I know not what&mdash;Oh, I possess a gift<BR>
So rare and precious, that, like men who go<BR>
Laden with rubies, I am grown suspect<BR>
Of all the earth and heaven, feel the stars<BR>
Peer covetously on me.  Every hour<BR>
That he is from my side a cloud of woe<BR>
Settles upon me like a swarm of bees.<BR>
Ah, is it possible that we can sin<BR>
In happiness, against a jealous God?<BR>

THE MOTHER<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Nay, nay, these foolish thoughts! your wits are strayed<BR>
With too much brooding: let me bind afresh<BR>
The knot of scarlet lilies in your hair;<BR>
They fade already, for the sun is high<BR>
Towards the noon: Ah, child, what waits for you<BR>
But love, and yet more love, and happiness,<BR>
And children of delight, and in old age<BR>
Respect of all the peoples, and at last<BR>
Death in his arms and burial in peace?<BR>
Still do you tremble, what is it you fear?<BR>

THE WIFE<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Can you not feel a something in the air,<BR>
A warning, or a presence, or the weight<BR>
Of some unguessed-at horror, that, like dust<BR>
Impalpable and deadly, clings and kills?<BR>
There is some terror&mdash;'tis my heart that speaks<BR>
And warns me&mdash;ah! would God indeed, your son,<BR>
(My love and husband) had another father<BR>
Than that celestial being.  This it is<BR>
That puts eternal sadness on his brow,<BR>
And shade within his eyes I cannot lift,<BR>
Even with kisses; 'tis the angel nature<BR>
That makes him sit spell-woven in a trance,<BR>
Chin in his hand, and eyes on vacancy,<BR>
And lips all bare of love, the while his soul<BR>
Struggles against the bonds of finity.<BR>

So that I may compare your flowers with mine,<BR>

It was a night of gods, a night of love.<BR>
The earth was still beneath a summer sky<BR>
So thickly sown with stars, that it appeared<BR>
A vase of ebon in a silver shroud;<BR>
No breath there stirred, the hot air seemed to hang<BR>
In heavy folds, like silken tapestry,<BR>
Clinging, caressing; all the birds were still,<BR>
No nightingale with her ecstatic pain<BR>
Transfixed the silence; earth was dead asleep,<BR>
Sunk in a scented languor; every flower<BR>
Steamed all its odour forth, as it would pour<BR>
Its soul before the mystery of love.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I into the night had stolen forth,<BR>
Oppressed, with pain or joy, I knew not which,<BR>
Knew only that the blood throughout my veins<BR>
Did run like liquid fire, head to foot<BR>
I tingled with sensation, all my hair<BR>
Stirred, as with separate life within itself;<BR>
And as I plucked the flowers and wove them in,<BR>
Purple and waxen, languorously sweet,<BR>
They seemed anticipation of a touch<BR>
Should make each thread of hair become a bird,<BR>
Fluttering with outstretched wings.  From off my breast<BR>
I flung my garment back; the soft air wooed<BR>
Like sleepy lips ere love is yet awake.<BR>
Then, as I lingered in the dusky depths,<BR>
All flower-shadowed, blacker than the night,<BR>
Blacker than shadows cast by palace walls<BR>
Upon a moonlit night, there, in that web<BR>
Of close-knit darkness, suddenly there came<BR>
The wonder unto me, the god, my love&mdash;<BR>
Within mine ears there was a silver silence,<BR>
And in my heart a golden burst of song,<BR>
The darkness burned around me, with a light<BR>
Born from the other worlds, and there he stood,<BR>
Radiant, godlike, purple were his wings<BR>
And splashed with fire, purply-black his hair<BR>
And crowned with stars for flowers; in his eyes<BR>
My soul sank into passion and was drowned.<BR>

CHORUS<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, what a pair of birds,<BR>
Hidden among the leaves!<BR>
He a god and she a maid,<BR>
Deathless lips on mortal laid;<BR>
(Nothing death retrieves.)<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There a son of God<BR>
And child of mortal seed<BR>
Met and kissed as love with love;<BR>
Oh the leaves were thick above,<BR>
No stars saw the deed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No stars, but the eye of God?<BR>
Ah, perchance He saw<BR>
How a god to mortal prayed<BR>
And the fatal compact made<BR>
'Gainst eternal law.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Veiled and still the night.<BR>
So, a fount of tears<BR>
Springs at first unseen, unguessed,<BR>
Till at last the flood confessed<BR>
Gushes down the years.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Son of a son of God<BR>
And the daughter of men too frail!<BR>
Union of the nature's twain?<BR>
Only sorrow and want and pain,<BR>
Striving without avail;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Desire for wings of a god<BR>
Tied to the will of a man;<BR>
Memory of a boundless space,<BR>
(Where stars and spheres their dance enlace)<BR>
With the threescore human span<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Hung like a bridge, in the gulf<BR>
Of God's eternity.<BR>
Oh a mind to know and a heart to crave<BR>
Beyond the horizon of the grave<BR>
To the bounds of infinity!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet ever Fate compels<BR>
This infinite desire<BR>
To match with cramped and finite brain;<BR>
And all of heaven earth may gain<BR>
Is smoke, where should be fire.<BR>

SCENE II<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="t3b">
THE SEEKER<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The air is heavy, all the winds are still<BR>
So that my own breath hangs about my head<BR>
Like incense o'er an altar.  Now the earth<BR>
Lies in a swoon, and all the flowers droop<BR>
Weighting their stems, ranged in their brazen pots<BR>
Without the house: the very petals lie<BR>
Like languid limbs relaxed; this crimson rose<BR>
Looks as if blood-steeped, almost to my sense<BR>
Smells of the same, the lilies are like death.<BR>
There is a taint of sickness in the air<BR>
Through all the noonday light&mdash;like fever chill<BR>
In fever burning,&mdash;and the sky is brass;<BR>
The very tinkle of the fountain spray<BR>
Is dead and tuneless, even the fresh springs<BR>
Have lost their freshness, run from off my hands<BR>
In drops of lead, and all my spirit seems<BR>
Weighed and confined with fetters of decay.<BR>
Because I have loved beauty more than most<BR>
And striven to pluck out the heart of it;<BR>
Because I have such sense of lovely things<BR>
That I can pour my soul in thankfulness<BR>
Before a leaf God makes to grow aright,<BR>
A unit of perfection; 'tis ordained<BR>
Because I love most still I most must lack<BR>
Love's satisfaction, quietude of soul&mdash;<BR>
Still must I find such void disparity<BR>
Between the false and true, and yet they grow<BR>
Together, intermingled; true is false<BR>
Itself, by sometime seeming, who shall find<BR>
The point where false and true are reconciled?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The very flower that we stoop to smell<BR>
Grows from a dunghill, look but in its roots,<BR>
And what obscene and hideous blind life<BR>
Goes teeming; sickened then we shrink aback<BR>
From rose's velvet petals.  So the soul<BR>
Holds best and meanest in a common cup.<BR>
Yet must there be a law in things that are<BR>
Seemingly lawless, purify the sight<BR>
And truth must surely then be visible,<BR>
Disparity made clear; the eye of God<BR>
Sees good in everything, thereto I strive,<BR>
To see with God's own vision, be more clear<BR>
In speech, than God, to asking human hearts.<BR>
Then is the tangle straightened, and the world<BR>
Lies in perspective, as before me lie,<BR>
Traced through the shimmering heat, the palaces,<BR>
Towers and temples, gardens and granaries,<BR>
Of this fair City, melting far away<BR>
Into the sunlight-flooded hills at last.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet must I sit here for a little while,<BR>
Where many columns make a heavy gloom,<BR>
And with the trickle from the water-jars<BR>
Of unfresh water, cheat myself awhile<BR>
With thought of evening freshness.  Oh my soul<BR>
Is wearier than my body with the toil,<BR>
It aches with length of watching.  I have strained<BR>
My spiritual eyes to catch a glimpse of dawn<BR>
And nothing seen but blackness.  Let me rest<BR>
As rest the quiet dead from doubt and toil;<BR>
Like silver feathers from the wings of God<BR>
Sleep fans my senses&mdash;&mdash;<BR>
</P>

THE CHORUS<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sleep, and forget, forget the aching toil,<BR>
The disappointments, and the long delays,<BR>
The watches of the night-time and the morn,<BR>
The lonely hours, unrewarded days;<BR>
Sleep, and forget.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In death we all are equal, great and small<BR>
Brought to the common level of the dust;<BR>
There is no glory that survives the years,<BR>
Nay, nay, alike we shall be as we must;<BR>
Sleep and forget.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In sleep we are omnipotent as gods,<BR>
Beyond our furthest wish we can attain,<BR>
Unfettered by the chain of circumstance;<BR>
Sleep then; or waking, turn and pray again<BR>
A little more to sleep and to forget.<BR>

Ah me, your fears have settled on my heart;<BR>
I fear the very day, there is a strange<BR>
Portentous look o'er all the earth, my hand<BR>
Stretched in the sunlight seems to throw no shade<BR>
As if the natural laws had all stood still&mdash;<BR>
I breathe as in a nightmare, breath oppressed;<BR>
I start at every sound, but fear no sound<BR>
So much as stillness, which descends on us<BR>
Like a great mantle choking out our hearts.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
As I lay in the shadow of the court<BR>
During the noonday fierceness, watched the rays<BR>
Chequered between the lattice window work,<BR>
And listened to the fountain in the grove<BR>
Of orange trees go singing to itself&mdash;<BR>
Behold, all suddenly before me stood<BR>
My lover-god, the angel ever dear,<BR>
And radiant as that first night years ago,<BR>
There stood he; where the marble touched his feet<BR>
It glowed translucent like a sunlit gem,<BR>
The perfume of his hair had made me swoon<BR>
Had not his eyes compelled me.  Grave he looked,<BR>
Where gravity in such a beauteous thing<BR>
Could find occasion, and his voice was low<BR>
And troubled, warning me.  "Let not your son<BR>
Tempt God too far, He will not brook affront<BR>
Though son of mine should dare it; be assured<BR>
The secret of this riddle universe<BR>
Shall ne'er be known on earth, man was not made<BR>
For too much knowledge, mankind ceases then<BR>
When man too much aspires.  Speak to him<BR>
Lest he should bring destruction on your head<BR>
And on the world."  Thus spoke he, nothing more,<BR>
And ere my eyes could hold him he was gone.<BR>

And he has heard with the unheeding smile<BR>
One gives to children's prattle.  "Now at last<BR>
The hours bear fruit, and shall I hold my hand,"<BR>
He answered, "for your vision?  I have waited,<BR>
Now is the time when hope is justified;<BR>
Truth dawns, not even God Himself can stand<BR>

Now do I stand upon the very brink<BR>
Of my desire; as a soul released<BR>
And purified by passing through the rays<BR>
Of white Eternity, I view the world.<BR>
Now am I all at peace; the heart that yearns<BR>
In bitter loneliness through midnight hours<BR>
Yet cannot voice its longing, brain that weaves<BR>
Its subtle web around the central thought<BR>
Yet never can absorb it; and this form,<BR>
The visible pride of body, all complete<BR>
Are one in union; the body knows<BR>
Its uses and its worths and has no fear,<BR>
The heart no more is empty, I have found<BR>
Eternal love to fill it, and no more<BR>
Gropes the blind brain for the Great Definite.<BR>
Away from me, my people, lest the sight<BR>
Of loving faces blunt the senses keen,<BR>
Hovering on the pain of a new birth.<BR>

The shuttle of noon wove light and shade<BR>
Over the moss and around the trees,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our weapons down we fling."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Breathless and hushed the messengers spoke<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they told King Richard the news<BR>
How the kings were set and the council met,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kings to fight refuse.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Louder than ever laughed the King<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of his golden beard.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
So the sultry breezes of Ascalon<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saluted the lions three,<BR>

So he planted his banner firm and fast,<BR>

Richard arose and strode in haste<BR>

But word for word the Archduke gave.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Do you give me words?" cried Richard the King;<BR>

And he tore the flag like a worthless rag,<BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And he set his foot on the silken flag,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His foot on Austria's fame;<BR>
With a swordless hip, yet a smiling lip,<BR>

EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS

<P>
"Mr. Presland appears to be following in the footsteps of Schiller....
Considered generally, Mr. Presland's drama is a fine piece of work.
Excellent in its presentation of character, impressive in sentiment,
and dignified in metre, it lacks none of the greater qualities of the
historical drama...."&mdash;<I>Scotsman.</I>
</P>

<P>
"The author remains as simple and dignified in style as in his
treatment of the tragedy of 'Joan of Arc.'  There is no painful
straining after effect.  Act V. is really powerful."&mdash;<I>Evening
Standard</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Presland gives promise of becoming one of the most successful
living writers of poetic drama.  His 'Joan of Arc' we have reason to
remember, his 'Queen Mary' is no less striking.  There is no
Swinburnian welter of poetry here, but a very dramatically presented
study of a very baffling woman.  It would be difficult for anyone to
cavil at the poet's presentation of the time....  Nothing could be
finer, from a dramatic point of view, than her acting after the murder
of Rizzio....  The last act is a splendid bit of work; the savagery of
the street song and the last speech of Mary before signing her
abdication are equally dramatic and equally poetic on very diverse
lines.  The play is altogether noteworthy."&mdash;<I>Glasgow Herald</I>.
</P>

<P>
"... It would, in our estimation, be a decided acquisition to any
actor-manager who could arrange with the author to allow him to produce
it....  Space does not permit us to deal with it here as we would like
to do, or as it deserves, but we with pleasure commend it to our
readers in the most emphatic way...."&mdash;<I>Road</I>.
</P>

<P>
"... 'Mary Queen of Scots,' a work in which he equals and even exceeds
his marked success in dramatizing a theme from the history of the
heroic Maid of Orleans....  Its progress is well planned, and it
proceeds with spirit, several of the scenes being splendidly dramatic.
As literature the play is sustained at a high level in strong nervous
verse....  The characters are firmly drawn and
lifelike...."&mdash;<I>Liverpool Daily Post</I>.

JOAN OF ARC

<P CLASS="t3">
EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS
</P>

<P>
"An excellent drama....  The verse is always flexible, and at the right
moment rises into the atmosphere of poetry in which Shakespeare moves
with such freedom....  Joan is the soul and centre of the play, and the
author has done nobly by her.  We catch, as we read, some of the
infection that fell upon men's souls from her presence ... which simply
means that Mr. Presland has realised his historical characters so well
as to make them seem living....  What we have written is sufficient to
show with what dramatic truth and poetic sympathy the dramatist has
approached his great subject, and with what success he has handled
it."&mdash;<I>Glasgow Herald</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Presland has put some excellent workmanship into this new dramatic
picture of the Maid of Orleans....  The action never flags.  The verse
is fluid, natural, yet dignified, and adapts itself easily to the
varying requirements of the situations....  A play which leaves in the
reader's mind a picture that grows upon him.  One forgets everything
but Joan, and that not because of any lack of proportion in the
composition, but because of the naturalness and force of her beautiful
character."&mdash;<I>Bibliophile</I>.
</P>

<P>
"At once good drama and good poetry....  The well-known story is deftly
treated.  The verse is easy and vigorous&mdash;above all, it is
dramatic."&mdash;<I>Sheffield Daily Telegraph</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Presland's play shows how impressive Joan of Arc may be made as
the central figure in a 'history.' ... Written with faithful adherence
to Shakespearean traditions of form, it follows out in an interesting
sequence of scenes the several stages in the career of the Maid of
Orleans....  The piece is all the more impressive because it does not
bring in any invented theatrical love interest, or anything of that
sort, to confuse the simple lines of the accepted story."&mdash;<I>Scotsman</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Written in language which will commend itself to all educated people,
who will certainly not only be entertained, but instructed thereby.
The author has done his work excellently in every way."&mdash;<I>Road</I>.

AND THE DEFENCE OF VENICE
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS
</P>

<P>
"... The play is genuinely dramatic, and its impressiveness is
heightened by the dignity of the blank verse.  There is poetry on every
page, but the effects are gained, not by flaunting rhetoric, but by
simplicity of language, which is forcible through its truth....  We can
only advise those who love English verse to read this play; they will
see that poetry is still a living thing among us."&mdash;<I>Oxford Magazine</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Presland follows up his dramas 'Joan of Arc' and 'Mary Queen of
Scots,' with a picture, at once moving and terrible, of the siege of
Venice by the Austrians in 1849....  He has once more proved himself a
dramatist of that high poetic order which we have so often been told
died out with the eighteenth century."&mdash;<I>Literary World</I>.
</P>

<P>
"His new work condenses into four acts of vigorous and flexible blank
verse, always animated in movement, and skilfully wrought together into
a fine unity of action....  Mr. Presland's Manin is an impressive,
pathetic figure, and the play one which cultured readers should follow
with unqualified interest."&mdash;<I>Scotsman</I>.
</P>

<P>
"... The poetry never clogs the action and the whole play is tense with
the struggle in the soul of the hero....  The play thus becomes the
tragedy of a city but the triumph of a man, and the interplay of the
two ideas is finely wrought out.  It is not all sombre, but even the
gayest of its characters throbs to the heart-beat of Italy, and helps
to give unity to the drama."&mdash;<I>Glasgow Herald</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Written in blank verse, that is both flexible and dramatic, the author
gives an effect of spaciousness, combined with tense
feeling."&mdash;<I>Publisher's Circular</I>.
</P>

<P>
"In the unfolding of the story, Mr. Presland shows much greater genius
than he did in either of his two previous dramatic works....  The verse
is most flexible, and practically all through he moves with great
freedom and reaches real dignity; the action seldom flags, and the
whole work is truly dramatic.  Especially might we pick out the last
act as extremely powerful."&mdash;<I>Sheffield Telegraph</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Throughout this admirable piece of dramatic work there is clear
evidence of the author's extraordinary power as a delineator in poetic
drama of human character in its many phases.  His 'Joan of Arc' was a
work which one could not fail to remember by reason of its striking
characteristics; but we are convinced that remembrance of the 'Defence
of Venice' will be equally, if not more, indelible."&mdash;<I>Cape Argus</I>.

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
